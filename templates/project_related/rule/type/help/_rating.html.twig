<h4>Rating</h4>
<p>
    If an item should get a higher spam rating, you can set an additional spam rating for the item.
</p>
<p>
    The spam rating value will be calculated by multiplying the item rating and the spam rating factor which is defined in the rule.
</p>
<p>
    The rating is a float number from <code>0.0</code> to <code>unlimited</code>. If no rating is defined, the default rating is <code>1.0</code>.
    If the rating is set to <code>0.0</code>, the item will not be detected as spam since the spam rating value will be
    <code>0</code> in any case.
