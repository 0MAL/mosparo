<p>The provider rule type allows to filter for AS numbers and country codes.</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        To use the provider type it is required to configure the MindMax GeoLite2 database, otherwise, the provider items will not have any effect.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>AS number</strong>
        <p>Enter an AS number which is not allowed to make any submissions. All IP addresses which belongs to this AS will be blocked.</p>
        <p>
            <u>Example:</u> <code>123456</code>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Country</strong>
        <p>Enter an ISO country code which is not allowed to make any submissions. All IP addresses which are registred in this country will be marked as spam.</p>
        <p>
            <u>Example:</u> <code>CH</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                If you add a country to the rule, it means that nobody from this country can make a submission. While this sounds good on one side
                it could mean that this will block a real user from submitting a form. Please be careful with this option.
                The correct localization of IP addresses is never guaranteed.
