<p>The website rule type allows to filter for URLs.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>URL</strong>
        <p>Enter an URL which is not allowed to submit a submission.</p>
        <p>
            <u>Example:</u> <code>//example.com/spam/test-form.html</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                It is recommend to start the URL with the protocol or with two slashes for protocol-independent URLs.
                If the value does not start with the protocol the rule could match wrong URLs.
            </strong>
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
