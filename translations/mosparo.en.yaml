      infoDefaultAndDataType: The rating is a float number from %zero% to %unlimited%. If no rating is defined, the default rating is %one%.
      infoValueEqualZero: If the rating is set to %zero%, the item will not be detected as spam since the spam rating value will be %zero% in any case.

    requestDelaying:
      title: Request delaying
      intro: To make it harder for bots, mosparo can delay the creation of submit tokens. Without a submit token, a form cannot be submitted. The user will see, how long he has to wait, until the form is submittable.
      infoIpAddress: In which case the creation of the token needs to be delayed, will be decided because of the number of requests the IP address has made. With every additional token request, the delay will be extended.

    ipLockout:
      title: IP Lockout
      intro: To make it even harder for bots, mosparo can automatically block IP addresses temporary. If an IP address requests a lot of tokens, mosparo can automatically count the requests and block the IP address if a specific number is reached.
