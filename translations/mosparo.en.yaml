        infoCountryBlock: If you add a country to the rule, it means that nobody from this country can make a submission. While this sounds good on one side it could mean that this will block a real user from submitting a form. Please be careful with this option. The correct localization of IP addresses is never guaranteed.

    unicodeBlock:

    minimumTime:
      title: Minimum Time
      intro: The minimum time functionality will measure the time between the initialization of the mosparo checkbox (when the page loads) and the validation of the submission (after the form was submitted). If this time is lower than the entered number below, the validation is invalid. If you have a short form, this check should be disabled or you should us a very low number.

    honeypot:
      title: Honeypot
      intro: A honeypot field is a hidden field in the form. Humans will not be able to see it - but spam bots will probably fill some content in this field. If that happens, we know that it was not a human so we can block the submission.

    requestDelaying:
      title: Request delaying
      intro: To make it harder for bots, mosparo can delay the creation of submit tokens. Without a submit token, a form cannot be submitted. The user will see, how long he has to wait, until the form is submittable.
      infoIpAddress: In which case the creation of the token needs to be delayed, will be decided because of the number of requests the IP address has made. With every additional token request, the delay will be extended.

    ipLockout:
      title: IP lockout
      intro: To make it even harder for bots, mosparo can automatically block IP addresses temporary. If an IP address requests a lot of tokens, mosparo can automatically count the requests and block the IP address if a specific number is reached.

    ipAllowList:
      title: IP allow list
