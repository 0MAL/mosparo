## Reporting a vulnerability
Please send us your report via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/mosparo/mosparo/security/advisories) or by email to security@mosparo.io. Please send us as much information as you can. We ask you to avoid creating public issues before notifying us of any vulnerabilities. We will process all reported vulnerabilities with the highest priority.
